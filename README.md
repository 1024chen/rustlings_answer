My rustlings training answers

If you've started the [rustling exercise](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) but one of the chapters is holding you back, my answers might help

## how to use it ?
Find the chapters you need in the exercise folder and compare them.<br> You can also replace the exercise folder but this is not recommended


## Note
the version of rustlings is "5.5.1" in `Cargo.toml` of [rustling exercise](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)
